    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In a constantly developing world of modeling, Keras has become a trailblazer in open-source software, providing a Python interface for producing artificial neural networks. By introducing these deep-learning techniques and complex pattern recognition algorithms, data scientists have been able to apply code to answer and solve many niche use cases that were previously unreasonable to achieve.  These applications include a few examples like Image Classification, `Natural Language Processing (NLP)`, Audio Processing, and Anonmaly Detection, which can lead to powerful models that can be utilized to make actionable decisions, reduce significant analysis time and complete tasks that were previously only possible by leveraging substantial human brainpower.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, organizations like law enforcement agencies can utilize these models for facial or object detection, helping them locate individuals of interest, while a more business oriented application could be to perform a sentiment analysis on a company's mass of textual reviews, leveraging the power of NLP's. In this example walk-through we will focus on the latter, and conduct a **sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews, capable of determining whether a review was positive or negative based on the text it contains**."

    "First, we need to load and prepare our dataset. This involves reading the data from CSV files, ensuring that it is loaded correctly, and re-coding the labels to make them more suitable for our machine learning use case. In this first chunk of code, we read-in each training and test data CSV's into their own dataframe, specifying the three column names in order: `polarity`, `title`, and `text`, which was determined from inspecting the Kaggle datacard supplied with our set."

    "The next step we take is to transform our target variable in which we want to predict, which is 'polarity' or aka the sentiment that the reviewer produces with their textual feeback.  The transformation applied in technically not needed, however typically in data science, we build models to predict in the form of 1's, indicating something of interest occuring, and 0, indicating the opposite.  In our case we could've left our target variable in the form of 2 for positive reviews, and 1 for negative reviews, but for best practice and clearly defined interpretations, we re-coded this variable to binarily represent positive sentiment.  **Simply put, positive reviews will be predicted as 1 and negative reviews will be 0.** To ensure a correct application of this process, we created a new variable named, `sentiment_positive` to hold the new 1's and 0's, as a way to be able to visually check that the lambda function kept all the data's patterns and only changed the labels.  The next lines of code extract the text and the re-coded sentiment labels from the DataFrame into separate arrays, which are then used for training and testing the machine learning model. \n"

Standardization involves cleaning the text data by removing HTML tags like breaks ( < br >) and punctuation using regular expressions from the `re` package and string manipulation functions from the `string` package, to ensure the text is in a consistent format before modeling. Vectorization transforms the text data into numerical form so that our neural network can process it, and we use Keras's TextVectorization layer for this purpose."

This model consists of an embedding layer for word embeddings, convolutional layers for feature extraction, and dense layers for classification.

A CNN is a type of deep learning model that is particularly effective for tasks involving spatial data, like images or text sequences, because it can automatically detect and learn hierarchical patterns and features from the input data.  **Due to the mass of data accessible to us, we only needed one epoch to train the model effectively an achieve a test accuracy of 92.44%.**  The term \"epoch\" refers to one cycle through the full training dataset.  In our case, a single epoch was sufficient for the model to learn and accurately predict on unfamiliar data, which is the end goal of a modeling application."

    "In this model, we use `binary_crossentropy` to measure our loss (or error) because we are dealing with a binary classification problem (positive vs. negative sentiment), while the optimizing function used is adam, which is an efficient gradient descent algorithm. The key metric we focus on in this example is accuracy, which tells us the proportion of correctly classified reviews. In this case, our model achieved an accuracy of approximately 92%, meaning that the model correctly identifies whether a review is positive or negative 92% of the time, when applied to the test_set of unseen reviews.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Achieving 92% accuracy indicates that our model is highly effective at distinguishing between positive and negative reviews. For practical applications, this level of accuracy can significantly aid businesses in understanding their customers' sentiment, which in turn can lead to many actionable decisions. For example, businesses can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Monitor Customer Feedback: By quickly identifying and responding to negative reviews, improving their customer service and satisfaction. In doing this, businesses can enhance their reputation and retain customers by promptly addressing their concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Perform Market Analysis: In analyzing trends in customer sentiment over time, business can better inform their marketing strategies.  Understanding how customers feel about different products or services allows them to tailor their marketing efforts more effectively, targeting areas that resonate positively with their audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Improvement Products: Gaining insights into specific features or aspects of products that customers feel strongly about, whether positively or negatively could be invaluable for product development teams to focus on enhancing features that customers love and addressing issues that lead to dissatisfaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the model's ability to accurately classify sentiment provides businesses with powerful insights into customer opinions, enabling them to make data-driven decisions that can enhance customer experience, optimize marketing strategies, and drive product improvements.  As a final reminder, this was only possible by leveraging Keras's NLP best practices and structure, which can be applied to countless other data science use cases. "
