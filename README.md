# Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio!

I am Riley Svensson, a data scientist with a master's degree in business analytics from Cal Poly's Orfalea College of Business. This repository is a collection of my work in data science across many domains, which additionally showcases my undergraduate experience in business and statistics.

## About 

During my four years as an undergraduate at Cal Poly, I began as a business major and found a passion for Information Systems as a concentration. This rapidly growing industry proved to be the perfect fit for me. Combined with over ten courses in statistics and my comprehensive business knowledge, I developed the ability to be both a technical analyst and an effective communicator, presenting complex topics to non-technical leaders with clarity and confidence.

Cal Poly's prestigious Master's program in Business Analytics equipped me with the essential skills to excel in today's data-driven world. My foundational knowledge in **Python, R, and SQL** is critical for any data analysis pipeline. Additionally, hands-on courses in **Cloud Computing** provided practical experience with AWS services, including S3, Lambda, and SageMaker. Courses in **Econometrics** offered extensive training in R's modeling capabilities, especially within the financial data domain. Other areas covered included **Data Mining and Data Analytics**, where I utilized R to uncover patterns from large datasets, while **People Analytics and Marketing Analytics** allowed me to work with HR data and focus on tracking KPI's.

Throughout the program, I participated in **2 consultancy projects** for innovative companies, **Salesforce and Claritas**. In these projects my teams secured **1st place**, as voted on by clients and faculty due to our clear presentation and uniquely valuable results. These experiences have honed my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges, demonstrating my expertise and versatility in the field of data science.
