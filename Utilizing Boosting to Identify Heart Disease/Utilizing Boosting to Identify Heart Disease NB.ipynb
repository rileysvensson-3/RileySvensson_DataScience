    "The primary goal of this machine learning project is to identify the presence of heart disease in patients using boosting techniques. Boosting is a powerful ensemble method that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong predictive model. By leveraging this approach, we aim to enhance the accuracy and robustness of our heart disease prediction model."

However, I chose to first investigate the 2020 model's test error before applying the model to completely unseen data from 2022. This approach ensures the model's relevance to current data. By doing this, if certain factors are no longer significant in 2022, I can account for this within the 2022 model and denote which factors have lost their importance"

    "Now that we have a well-defined feature set from 2020, that performs somewhat well in predicting the imbalanced target variable, \"Heart Disease\".  We will re-evaluate these features or \"best model\" on an updated slice of heart disease data from 2022.  This will allow us to actually test if the features or predictor variables that have attribute to a rise or fall in risk for heart disease, are still having an effect 2 years later, following major from Covid-19.  To keep the data consistent and allow for an ad-hoc causal analysis to be conducted, I chose to only include the same 19 predictors from our best boosting model for 2020, to ensure that any changes are likely due to societal effect and not the exclusion or inclusion of a variable."

    "\n",
    "For this context, the performance metric selected could be a range of many things, from accuracy, to f1-score, and even more granular options like predicted true positive rate, Precision.  It is obvious due to a severly imbalanced data set that accuracy and even f1-score are greatly affected, and could show great results for a model that simply predict's every patient to have no heart disease, lending for example a 70% success model.  **Precision in this case, indicates how many patients with heart disease are correctly captured by the model, or were predicted Yes and in fact had heart disease. And in this case, with real-life data predicting an event that is extremely unlikey to happen but very crucial to catch when it does occur, we wish to maximum precision.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "A test precision of 25%, would only be correcting classifying 1/4 of the at people at risk for heart disease, however we are willing to overclassify people as having a risk for heart disease, when they may not actually have it.  The other side of this error would be to missclassify patients as healthy, instead of flagging them to come in for a consultation.  **The potential consequences of this decision are far more serious than the mental scare of being checked out for heart risk but being healthy, only leading to wasted time and potentially minor visit costs.  If someone is missclassified by our model as healthy when they are not, this could not only result in a death but also potential legal complications.** For these reasons, I selected to focus on Precision as a final metric of validation."

    "In both years 2020 and 2022, we were able to determine a model capable of somewhat predicting Heart Disease, with a final precision of 16.89% in 2022, which is extremely difficult to detect using data as it is such an anomaly.  Utilizing extreme gradient boosting resulted in 20% precision, while applying a combination of **ADA boost on a Decision Tree Model resulted in the best precision results** with 5% increase to 25% in 2020.  Many models would simply predict a \"No\" for all observations, making it useless and inaccurate.  While it is difficult to determine the exact effect of each variable on Heart Disease, it is useful to even have a set of variables or factors that are known to effect risk heart health.  Common sense can be used to determine that **those who Smoke are more likely to have heart complications**, and **those who participate in Physical Activities result in a lower chance**. There is a large effect due to Age Category, **with typically older aged individuals having increased risk** as well, while there is a relationship based on the Sex of the individual, however the direction is unknown. \n",

    "In terms of some variables that had minimal predictive impact in both 2020 and 2022, when removing \"Race\", this resulted in an improvement in our model's predictions, indicating that Race is not a factor majorly contributing to a person's heart health which could have been expected as there shouldn't be biological differences in heart health, but rather other demographic factors that contribute to a person's health.  On the other hand, **when removing the predictors like `Asthma`, `Diabetic`, and `Physical Activity`, the predictability of our model decreased significantly**, meaning that these factors have a profound impact on Health Disease, **with a positive relationship for Asthma/Diabetes and negative for those participating in Physical Activity.**  However, it is worth noting that our **predictive ability decreases from 2020 to 2022, from 25% to around 14.6%** indicating that there may be some new factors attributing to having a heart attack that were not included in 2020, like having Covid-19.  As a next step, we could look into these remaining variables to train a model, in hopes of clearly discovering which one of these factors is the culprit for this change. "
